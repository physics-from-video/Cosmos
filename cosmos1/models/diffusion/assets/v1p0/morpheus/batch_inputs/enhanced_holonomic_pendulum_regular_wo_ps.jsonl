{"prompt": "A pendulum with a spherical ball attached swings back and forth in a controlled manner, its motion captured in a moment of retrograde swing. The pendulum's arm, likely made of metal, extends horizontally from a stand, connected to a pivot point that allows for rotational movement. The ball, positioned at the lower end of the pendulum, appears to be in motion, indicating the pendulum's swing. The environment suggests a laboratory or testing setting, with a backdrop of technical apparatus and equipment, and the lighting is artificial, casting a uniform glow over the scene. The pendulum's movement, while currently in a retrogressive swing, could potentially change direction, continuing its oscillatory motion.", "visual_input": "/scratch-shared/${USER}/frames_for_generation/holonomic_pendulum_06_11_2024/video_5_fps30/frame_66.png"}
