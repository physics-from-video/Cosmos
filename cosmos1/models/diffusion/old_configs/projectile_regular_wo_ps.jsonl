{"prompt": "A single, small 3D-printed ball, dark gray in color, is launched from a plastic, small-scale ramp with a slight upward angle. The ball follows a natural, smooth, arcing trajectory upward and then downward, continuing along that arc until it exits the right side of the video frame. The video should accurately simulate the ball's motion under standard earth gravity, showing a clear parabolic arc. The video should emphasize a smooth and realistic physics-based movement of the ball without any sudden changes in speed. The ball should not bounce or collide with any objects in the scene.", "visual_input": "/scratch-shared/${USER}/frames_for_generation/projectile_24_01_2025/video_0_fps30_cropped/frame_25.png"}
