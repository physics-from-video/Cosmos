{"prompt": "In a meticulously crafted scene, a solitary, dark gray 3D-printed ball, with its sleek, spherical form, is propelled from a plastic ramp that slopes gently upward. The ball, weighing a mere fraction of a kilogram, is captured in high-definition, showcasing every nuance of its motion. As it leaves the ramp's edge, the ball arcs gracefully into the air, its trajectory a perfect parabola that mirrors the laws of physics under standard earth gravity. The video's frame follows the ball's smooth ascent and descent, highlighting the ball's consistent speed and the absence of any sudden accelerations or decelerations. The scene remains unobstructed, ensuring that the ball's journey is uninterrupted by any external forces, save for the pull of gravity, resulting in a visually stunning and scientifically accurate demonstration of a parabolic motion.", "visual_input": "/scratch-shared/${USER}/frames_for_generation/projectile_24_01_2025/video_0_fps30_cropped/frame_25.png"}
