{"prompt": "An orange ping-pong ball is captured in mid-air, suspended above a laboratory table, poised to make contact with the surface below. The ball's descent is governed by the force of gravity, creating an arc that suggests a controlled experiment in progress. The backdrop is a stark, clinical room with a neutral palette, punctuated by the sterile lines of a metal frame and the functional design of a nearby cabinet. The lighting is subdued, casting a soft glow that highlights the ball's trajectory and the anticipation of impact. The table beneath the ball is marked with faint lines, perhaps indicating measurements or guidelines for the experiment. As the ball continues its downward journey, it will likely bounce off the table, adding a dynamic element to the scene and marking the conclusion of this controlled descent.", "visual_input": "/scratch-shared/azadaianchuk/frames_for_generation/falling_ball_09_10_2024/video_0_fps30/videos/frame_160_9.mp4"}
