{"prompt": "The video shows a laboratory setup featuring an orange ping-pong ball falling down and making impact with the table surface below. The camera remains perfectly still, framing the ball with a shallow depth of field that blurs the background, enhancing its central presence.  The environment suggests an experimental or demonstration scenario, possibly related to physics or engineering. No camera movement or motion at all. Fixed camera pose.","visual_input": "./frames_for_generation/falling_ball_09_10_2024/video_0_fps30/videos/frame_160_9_cropped.mp4"}
